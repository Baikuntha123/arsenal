# Arsenal

Arsenal is the idea for a Blender integrated game engine written in Rust. Currently there is no game engine, it is just an idea, but we are currently doing the planning, investigation, experimentation, and documentation that is necessary to get the project started.

The current documentation can be found at [katharostech.github.io/arsenal](https://katharostech.github.io/arsenal).
