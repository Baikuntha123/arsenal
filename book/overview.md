# Overview

Arsenal is the idea for a Blender integrated game engine written in Rust. Currently there is no game engine, it is just an idea, but we are currently doing the planning, investigation, experimentation, and documentation that is necessary to get the project started.

To start, we are developing an [architecture outline](./architecture.md) that lays out how we want to structure the components of the project.
