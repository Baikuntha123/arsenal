# Architecture

We are currently in the process of prototyping the architecture for Arsenal. These are the drafts for the project architecture that we have made so far:

- [Draft 2](./architecture/draft-2.md) - The current plan for how Arsenal will be built. This may change and the draft will be update or else a new one created.
- [Draft 1](./architecture/draft-1.md) - The first design concept. See [draft status](./architecture/draft-1.md#draft-status) to see why it was decided against.
