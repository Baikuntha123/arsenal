<p>Arsenal is a Blender integrated game engine written in Rust. The project is in <em>very</em> early stages of development, but we are doing the planning, investigation, experimentation, and documentation that is necessary to get the project going. The source code for the project is on <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#getting-started" id="getting-started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>If you want to try out Arsenal, you can download the latest release <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/releases">here</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/blob/master/CHANGEFILE.md">change log</a> will have the list of the updates made with each release. The <a href="./getting-started.html">getting started</a> page will show you how to install Arsenal and run your first game.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#motivation" id="motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>We at <a href="https://katharostech.com">Katharos Technology</a> have been planning to use <a href="https://armory3d.org/">Armory3D</a> for our games until recent <a href="http://forums.armory3d.org/t/armor3d-capability-questions/3118/8?u=zicklag">concerns</a> about Armory3D's Haxe runtimes were brought up and we decided that Armory runs the risk of not being able to handle large games due to the Haxe core. We believe that Rust is the best language for building a game engine and as such have been doing some investigation on how we would build a Rust game engine that offers the same advantages as Armory3D.</p>
<p>Arsenal will be built on top of the <a href="https://amethyst.rs">Amethyst</a> game engine and will provide a full Blender integration that will allow you to build games in Blender. Arsenal will also come with a Logic Node system that will allow non-programmers to build out game logic.</p>
<p>More details of what we are trying to accomplish with Arsenal can be found in our <a href="./vision.html">Vision</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#roadmap" id="roadmap">Roadmap</a></h2>
<p>You can view our <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/milestones">roadmap</a> by looking at the milestones on GitHub. The roadmap will likely change as we find out what work needs to be done more specifically.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#getting-started-1" id="getting-started-1">Getting Started</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to Arsenal's Getting Started page! This guide will tell you how to install Arsenal and run your first &quot;game&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Arsenal cannot make real games yet. Currently Arsenal can export your Blender scene to a game with colorless models, static lights, and an orbit camera. That's it. Still, this represents a big step in the direction of allowing you to make games inside of Blender, so if you are still interested, lets get started!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#installing" id="installing">Installing</a></h2>
<p>Arsenal is made up of a completely self-contained Blender plugin. Before you can use it you must install <a href="https://builder.blender.org/download/">Blender 2.80 Beta</a>. After installing Blender you can download the latest version of Arsenal from <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/releases">GitHub</a>. We have builds of Arsenal for 64bit Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded Arsenal, start up Blender and open the user preferences.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/blender-preferences.png" alt="Blender Preferences" /></p>
<p>In the Blender preferences go to the Add-ons tab and click Install.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/install-addon-button.png" alt="Install Add-on Button" /></p>
<p>Navigate to the arsenal zip file that you downloaded earlier and double-click it. This will add Arsenal to the Blender add-on list. Click the check box next to the add-on name to enable the add-on and then click &quot;Save Preferences&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some versions of Blender will not have the &quot;Save Preferences&quot; button. In that case the preferences will be automatically saved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./assets/enable-addon-checkbox.png" alt="Enable Add-on Check box" /></p>
<p>You can close the preferences dialog and that's it! Now all we have to do is run a game.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#running-a-game" id="running-a-game">Running a Game</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have Arsenal installed, go ahead and save the blend. You can't run an Arsenal game if the blend has not been saved yet. After the blend is saved, we can run it! We just have to click the &quot;Run Game&quot; button in the &quot;Arsenal&quot; panel of the &quot;Render&quot; tab.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/run-game-button.png" alt="Run Game Button" /></p>
<p>Here is the result:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/arsenal-with-a-cube.png" alt="Arsenal With a Cube" /></p>
<p>Arsenal will export the scene with the basic cube in it and it will run a game that allows you to view your scene by moving the mouse to orbit the camera around the world center. You can hit the escape button to exit the game.</p>
<p>Congratulations you ran your first Arsenal game! It isn't much yet, but it's a start.</p>
<p>So far there are a couple things to note about the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arsenal added two lights to the scene: a blue light and a red light. Arsenal doesn't yet export the lights from the Blender scene. That will be fixed in a later release</li>
<li>Arsenal only exports objects smooth shaded so the cube looks kind of non cube-like. This will also be fixed later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've got it running, lets mess around with our scene a bit more. Go ahead and add whatever objects you want to the scene and click &quot;Run Game&quot; again. Arsenal will re-export the scene and run the game with your new updates.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/full-arsenal-scene.png" alt="Full Arsenal Scene" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>That concludes our tutorial and shows you everything that Arsenal can do so far. The next thing that we will be working on is getting scripting support so that you can start to make the game do stuff.</p>
<p>If you had any trouble getting through the tutorial or if you have any questions, you can open up a <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/issues">GitHub issue</a> and we'll try to get it fixed. If you like what we are doing and you think that Arsenal is cool, give us a star on <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal">GitHub</a>!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-vision" id="the-vision">The Vision</a></h1>
<p>These need to be refined into a more succinct vision statement, but here are the major design points that drive the Arsenal vision:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need the engine to scale to a game of any size, even up to AAA games, with no technological bottleneck.
<ul>
<li>The engine core should be written in Rust
<ul>
<li>In order to make sure that engine performance is not a bottleneck, it needs to be written in a language that has multi-threading and that can integrate with native libraries.</li>
<li>Rust allows full control while eliminating entire classes of bugs and preventing vulnerabilities and hard to debug issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want the engine to be as easy to use and get started with as absolutely possible.
<ul>
<li>Armory successfully hit a lot of good points on ease of use and Arsenal will take a lot of pointers from Armory in that respect. We want to take all of the best things about Armory's user experience and make sure that Arsenal is not at a disadvantage to Armory in that respect.</li>
<li>We want to support visual scripting to allow non-programmers to make their own games.</li>
<li>The engine should provide a full Blender integration where you build your game scenes in Blender and export them instantly to a game. ( Textual scripting initially will only be supported in an any external editor such as VSCode, however visual scripting we hope will be done directly within Blender )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want the engine to be efficient.
<ul>
<li>The engine should, as much as possible, not use an absurd amount of system resources to run or develop games with.
<ul>
<li>We want the engine to be usable by as many people as possible and on as many different computers as possible without compromising on the quality of the engine and its capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The games in the engine should run on lower-end hardware as well as high-end hardware
<ul>
<li>Even though Arsenal should be able to support super large games that require a lot of system resources, it should not be limited in its ability to create small lightweight games that run on less modern and/or lower resource hardware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want the engine to be mod-able.
<ul>
<li>Modding is a very big deal to us, partially because modding was one of the major things that inspired us to want to make games in the first place. Allowing people to make games that can dynamically load user content is high on our priorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want the engine to be cross-platform
<ul>
<li>The engine should be able to run on all of the major platforms including game consoles and the web:
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Mac</li>
<li>Web</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>iPhone</li>
<li>PlayStation 4</li>
<li>XBox One</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want the engine to be Open Source and built on Open Source tools so that anybody can contribute and/or modify the engine to their own use-case.</li>
</ul>
<p>The engine should be able to compete with Unity, Unreal, Cryengine, etc. in the kinds of games you can create with it. It may or may not have all of the features of those game engines, though. The features that the engine comes with will be, at least initially, dependent on what we need to develop our own games at Katharos Technology. That doesn't mean that we won't support or integrate other features if somebody else wants to contribute them, and it doesn't mean that other features may not come later.</p>
<p>Even though the engine needs to be able to support large games, it should be easy to use and still be perfectly suitable for small indie games as well.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#architecture" id="architecture">Architecture</a></h1>
<p>At a high level, Arsenal is composed of three main components, all of which are located in the root of the Arsenal git repository: <strong>Arsenal Blender</strong>, <strong>Arsenal Blender Core</strong>, and <strong>Arsenal Runtime</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="development-guide/./assets/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture Diagram" /></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#arsenal-blender" id="arsenal-blender">Arsenal Blender</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/tree/master/arsenal_blender">Arsenal Blender</a> is the top level of the Arsenal Blender plugin. Arsenal Blender contains all of the Python code that creates the Arsenal UI elements and operators inside of Blender. Arsenal Blender is the &quot;glue&quot; that binds the <strong>Arsenal Blender Core</strong> and the <strong>Arsenal Runtime</strong> to the Blender interface. If you want to work on our Blender user-experience, this is the place to start.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#arsenal-blender-core" id="arsenal-blender-core">Arsenal Blender Core</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/tree/master/arsenal_blender_core">Arsenal Blender Core</a> is the portion of the Blender plugin that is written in Rust and that handles most of the heavy lifting in the Blender plugin. Arsenal Blender uses the Arsenal Blender Core to do the more process intensive tasks and it will use it to communicate with your Arsenal game while it is running to provide features like hot reload and live sync.</p>
<p>The goal of the Arsenal Blender Core is to provide the highest possible performance and to remove any limits on what the Arsenal Blender plugin can do. Because it is written in Rust instead of Python, the Arsenal Blender Core can accomplish things like multi-threading and communicating with native system libraries when necessary.</p>
<p>The Arsenal Blender Core is implemented as a native Python module and, even though it is written in Rust, it is imported by Arsenal Blender just like any other Python module would be. Because the Arsenal Blender Core is imported by Arsenal Blender, both components run fully inside of the Blender process.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#game-data" id="game-data">Game Data</a></h3>
<p>When you run an Arsenal game, your Blender file and all of the Logic Nodes and other code get exported to a <code>build_[projectname]</code> directory adjacent to the Blend. The Arsenal Blender Core is responsible for doing the export. The exported data is then loaded and run inside the Arsenal Runtime.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#arsenal-runtime" id="arsenal-runtime">Arsenal Runtime</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/tree/master/arsenal_runtime">Arsenal Runtime</a> is what is responsible for actually running the game data that is exported from Blender. This runs completely <strong>outside</strong> of Blender. This is important for licensing reasons, because you can not commercially market a game that has any Blender code in it. Arsenal games, despite being <em>developed</em> in Blender, will have no Blender code in the game.</p>
<p>The Arsenal Runtime is written in Rust and combines great tools from the Rust gamedev community. The bulk of the Arsenal runtime is built on top of the <a href="https://amethyst.rs">Amethyst</a> game engine.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#amethyst" id="amethyst">Amethyst</a></h3>
<p>Amethyst pulls most of the weight in the Arsenal runtime and provides windowing, audio, an ECS, a Renderer, an input system, and other components foundational to a running game. Amethyst takes care of a lot of the difficult aspects of designing a game engine for us and allows us to focus on our Blender user experience and integration.</p>
<p>Amethyst is also very modular in design which allows us to add or replace components as we need without locking us into a particular design.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#arsenal-components" id="arsenal-components">Arsenal Components</a></h3>
<p>In addition to Amethyst, we will also be developing additional components that are specific to Arsenal. This will include things like our live Blender sync and other features, many of which will still be built on top of other Amethyst components.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#faq" id="faq">FAQ</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#is-being-cross-platform-one-of-your-game-engines-main-focus" id="is-being-cross-platform-one-of-your-game-engines-main-focus">Is being cross platform one of your game engine's main focus?</a></h2>
<p>Yes. Arsenal should be able to deploy to every major target out there. This is going to be mostly handled by the <a href="https://amethyst.rs">Amethyst</a> engine that we are building on top of so it should not be a large burden to the project.</p>
<p>Compared to Armory, Arsenal will probably have less of an issue targeting multiple platforms because we don't have to maintain the Krom ( development, JavaScript ) version of Armory games and the C/C++ version of Armory games, which was what caused so much of a difficulty with the Bullet physics integration. Arsenal will have <strong>one</strong> version that can be used for production and for development so we won't have to manage two different runtimes. WASM support for Amethyst is also being <a href="https://amethyst.rs/posts/moss-grant-announce">sponsored by Mozilla</a> right now.</p>
<p>Also, because it is written in Rust, Arsenal shouldn't have any problem integrating with native libraries on different targets, something that gave Armory a bit of trouble because of Krom.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-platform-will-your-engine-focus-on" id="what-platform-will-your-engine-focus-on">What platform will your engine focus on?</a></h2>
<p>To start we will focus on the desktop platforms: Linux, Windows, and Mac. After that we will want to go to consoles. This is in the roadmap for the Amethyst project so we may not need to do any work on this ourselves.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-dimension-will-your-game-engine-focus-on" id="what-dimension-will-your-game-engine-focus-on">What dimension will your game engine focus on?</a></h2>
<p>3D will be the most important for us at first but it should not be hard to add extra controls that allow you to more easily create purely 2D elements after that. We definitely want you to be able to do both.</p>
<p>If we start with 3D, 2.5D is more of a special case of the physics engine, because it is 3D graphics, with 2D physics. The rust <a href="https://www.nphysics.org/">nphysics</a> library supports both 2D and 3D physics so that might end up being easy to accomplish.</p>
<p>Supporting pure 2D should just be a matter of rendering and making the UX inside of Blender easy enough to place 2D objects so that might also be an easy feature to add when we get to it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-will-your-game-engine-feature" id="what-will-your-game-engine-feature">What will your game engine feature?</a></h2>
<p>That is less clear at the present time. We will start by focusing on the core elements needed to make any game and on giving the developer enough control to work anything that they might need into their game. More specific features like terrain and AI editors would be great to work in eventually, but our development effort will be guided by the features that we need to develop our own games.</p>
<p>We should have no problem accepting contributions for extra features as long as we deem it compliant to our standards.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#when-do-you-intend-to-release-the-first-version-10" id="when-do-you-intend-to-release-the-first-version-10">When do you intend to release the first version? (1.0)</a></h2>
<p>We have no way of determining an accurate timeline at this point. It will definitely be more of a &quot;work on it until we feel it is stable&quot;. But as it is critical to our own  game development, it will have the highest of priorities.</p>
<p>We are going to develop a &quot;living&quot; roadmap that we will update as we figure out what we need to work into the engine. Initially it will likely be rather inaccurate until we figure out more of what needs to be worked into Arsenal and into Amethyst.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-do-you-support-your-game-engine-development" id="how-do-you-support-your-game-engine-development">How do you support your game engine development?</a></h2>
<p>Development of Arsenal is a part of the work of Katharos Technology as it will be the engine that we use to make our games. Work at Katharos Technology is funded by trusting God to provide for what we need to continue work. Donations are welcome.</p>
<p>We do not know where funding for the project will come from as the project continues; we are trusting that God will give us what we need to continue the project if that is His will. We will never charge for Arsenal, though. Arsenal will be free and Open Source from the start.</p>
<p>See our <a href="https://katharostech.com/about-us">about us</a> page to understand more about what our goal is as an organization.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-will-be-your-game-engine-license" id="what-will-be-your-game-engine-license">What will be your game engine license?</a></h2>
<p>The current plan is for the engine to be licensed under MIT, but the ownership of the copyright will be reserved by Katharos Technology. That means that contributors have to sign a <a href="https://cla-assistant.io/katharostech/arsenal">CLA</a> and that we may re-license the engine under any other license that we choose if we need to for any reason. This is to protect us, as an organization, from putting a legal restriction on our use of our own software that we may regret later. We have the full intention of always providing the software under a free and Open Source license; part of what we want to accomplish with Katharos Technology is to give people the tools they need to make their own games.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-do-you-decide-what-features-to-work-on" id="how-do-you-decide-what-features-to-work-on">How Do You Decide What Features to Work On?</a></h2>
<p>The development of the engine will be heavily directed by the need that we have for the engine at Katharos Technolgy. This means that we may not be able to facilitate developing features for everybody's use-cases, but it does mean that we have a vested interest in making the engine capable of producing high quality commercial games.</p>
<p>If other people want to contribute features that we may not have time to work on ourselves, there should be no reason that we cannot merge those features if they fit our vision.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#is-arsenal-a-blender-plugin-or-a-game-engine" id="is-arsenal-a-blender-plugin-or-a-game-engine">Is Arsenal A Blender Plugin or a Game Engine?</a></h2>
<p>In reality, even though we call Arsenal an engine, the plan is to build Arsenal almost entirely on top of the <a href="https://amethyst.rs">Amethyst</a> game engine while creating our own Blender based user experience. We have the documentation for the engine design <a href="https://katharostech.github.io/arsenal/architecture.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-does-arsenal-export-gltf-instead-of-just-using-blender-files" id="why-does-arsenal-export-gltf-instead-of-just-using-blender-files">Why Does Arsenal Export glTF Instead of Just Using Blender Files?</a></h2>
<p>There are three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Keeping up with the Blender file format could be time-consuming as it is a moving target. Comparatively, the glTF format is very simple and standardized.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> The blender format contains a lot of metadata that we don't need for a game, such as the Blender UI layout.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> If you use the Blender file format, the game would have to decode the .blend file while the game is running. This would involve going through more information than is actually needed in the game and would require more CPU to get the required data. glTF is a very dense format that compactly stores the information we need while also facilitating efficient extraction into a running game.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#news" id="news">News</a></h1>
<p>Here is a record of significant events or updates made to the engine. We will make an effort to keep this up-to-date as things progress.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#july-2019" id="july-2019">July 2019</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>6th</strong>: The first <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/releases/tag/v0.1.0">release</a> of Arsenal!</li>
